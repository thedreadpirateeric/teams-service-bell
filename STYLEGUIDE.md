"""Style guildlines.

Caseing:
Function should use snake_case.
    * function, my_function

Variable should use camelCase to easily distingush between functions and
variables.
    * x, var, myVariable

Classes should start each word with a capital letter. CapCase.
    * Model, MyClass

Method should use snake_case.
    * class_method, method

Constant should use all uppercase with underscores.
    * CONSTANT, MY_CONSTANT, MY_LONG_CONSTANT

Module should use lowercase word or words. Separate words with underscores.
    * module.py, my_module.py

Package should use a lowercase word or words. Do not separate words with
underscores and do not use a dash.
    * package, mypackage

This module demonstrates documentation as specified by the `Google Python
Style Guide`_. Docstrings may extend over multiple lines. Sections are created
with a section header and a colon followed by a block of indented text.

Example:
    Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
    sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
    literal blocks::

        $ python example_google.py

Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks
are also implicitly created anytime a new section starts.

Attributes:
    moduleLevelVariable1 (int): Module level variables may be documented in
        either the ``Attributes`` section of the module docstring, or in an
        inline docstring immediately following the variable.

        Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose
        one convention to document module level variables and be consistent
        with it.

Todo:
    * For module TODOs
    * You have to also use ``sphinx.ext.todo`` extension
